# VLAN documentation 

When it comes to networking, VLANs are the unsung heroes. Theyâ€™re like the secret agents of the network world, keeping things running smoothly behind the scenes.

In our project we decided to use VLANs to divide our network into smaller, more manageable chunks. This way, we can keep our network traffic organized and secure.

## VLANs in Our Network
- **VLAN 10:** The Servers. Where the internet meets the network.
- **VLAN 20:** The cool kids' table. Management and Support.
- **VLAN 30:** Where Study get stuff done.
- **VLAN 40:** Production's playground.

Each VLAN has its own subnet, and we've got a plan for every IP. Here's the breakdown:
